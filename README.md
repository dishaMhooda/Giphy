# Giphy

## Short description of the project
This project is developed in Kotlin using the concept of clean architecture (MVVM design pattern)
- This project uses Kotlin , Room , Coroutine , Flow.
- This project also contains test case for testing Api calls , Database and Flow.
- Glide has been used for handling images/gif.
- Viewpager and tab has been used
- Infinite paging has been added.
- Searchbar is there which stores the searched history.
- Storing and retrieving of favourite giphy has been added.

## Improvement to be done
- Need to add more test cases.
- UI related changes required.
- For now giphy are directly displayed from the response received but they are not stored in database. Once reponse has been stored in database, giphy will be displayed from database and it will improve inifite scrolling also, as for now older records are not displayed.
- Comments are not added in the entire project , so need to add that.
- Dark theme support needs to be improved.
- Testing of few features is yet pending.
